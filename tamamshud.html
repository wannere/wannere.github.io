          <h1>I. The Body</h1>
          <p><span class="accent">1948</span><br/><span class="accent">Adelaide, South Australia</span></p>
          <p>At 6:30 AM the morning of 1 December, a man was found sitting against the sea wall on Somerton Beach, near Glenelg. Upon further inspection, the man was not sleeping or drunk as was first suspected—he was dead.</p>
          <p>A first investigator of the scene noted that the man was well-dressed, a fallen cigarette rested on his collar, and that he wore no hat (unusual for 1948). The body was transported to a coroner, who estimated the time of death to be 2 AM that morning. The content of the man’s pockets included tickets from Adelaide to the beach on which he was found, a pack of Juicy Fruit gum, matches, two combs, and a pack of Army Club cigarettes containing a different, more expensive British brand called Kensitas. <span class="accent">He carried no wallet, no cash, and no ID.</span> One of the man’s pockets was repaired with orange thread, while all of his clothes had the labels carefully cut out, further inhibiting his identity.</p>
          <p>The coroner performed an autopsy, but was unable to find cause of death. The spleen was more than three times the normal size and the liver was filled with blood which suggested poisoning, but there was nothing to show that poison had been in the man’s last meal. Furthermore, the man’s resting place at Somerton Beach showed no trace of the vomiting and convulsions that would accompany such a poison. Repeated tests on both blood and organs failed to reveal any trace of poison, and the examiner did not note an official cause of death. <span class="accent">His fingerprints were not matched to any known in Australia or the English speaking world.</span></p>
          <p>Other features noted in the examination included that the man’s calf muscles were unusually high and well developed, while his toes were oddly wedge shaped. An expert witness suggests that the man had perhaps been a ballet dancer. In a later investigation, it was also noted that the man had two rare genetic features, one where the top hollow of the ear is larger than the bottom, and the other where both lateral incisors are missing. Both occur in only 2% of the general population.</p>

          <p>By 11 January the investigation was widened to search for any abandoned personal possessions. A brown suitcase had been left in the cloakroom at the main railway station on 30 November and was turned over to the police.</p>
          <p>It contained a reel of orange thread identical to the one used to repair the man’s pocket, a stenciling kit, a modified table knife, shaving gear, and electrician’s screwdriver, and several clothing items. A jacket in the suitcase was stitched using a feather stitch unknown in Australia. <span class="accent">A tailor identified the jacket as American in origin; however shipping and immigration labels provided no leads.</span></p>
          <p>The other clothes in the suitcase also had the labels cut off, except for three, which bore the name T. Keane, though one spelled the surname “Kean”, without the final e. There were no spare socks in the suitcase, and no correspondence or other clues to his identity. <span class="accent">There was no T. Keane missing in any English-speaking country.</span></p>

    <!-- III. The Rubaiyat

          <h1>III. The Rubaiyat</h1>
          <p>In April 1949, another examination of the man’s body and possessions produced a mystifying clue. In a small pocket sewn into the waistband of his trousers was a small scrap of paper typeset with the words “Tamám Shud”. The words were traced back to a book of 12th century Persian poetry called The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Though a rare book, it had become popular in Australia through a translation by Edward Fitzgerald. Police inquiries into libraries, publishers, and bookstores failed to find an edition the used the same type as the paper found in the man’s pocket; but the words were confirmed to have come from the book. <span class="accent">They were the last words in most English translations, meaning “finished” or “it is ended”.</span></p>
          <p>In July, the search for the right Rubaiyat finally concluded. A man told police that his car was usually parked near Somerton Beach and soon after the body was found, his brother-in-law had found a copy of The Rubaiyat on the floor by the rear seats. It had sat in the glove compartment until a newspaper article about the search was published. Upon closer inspection, the last page had the last few words torn out.</p>
          <p><span class="accent">On the rear cover there was a penciled-in phone number. Underneath were the faint impression of some capital letters.</span> The impressions were made up of five lines of jumbled letters, the second of which was crossed out. There was a pair of straight lines with an x written through them that separated the first three lines from the last two. It looked like some sort of code.</p>

          <p id="second">Adelaide police were unable to crack the meaning of the letters, so it was sent to Naval Intelligence and published in the press. Amateur codebreakers didn’t succeed, and Naval Intelligence was similarly lost. Their only assertion was that the letters corresponded to the frequency of initial letters of words in English and that a reasonable explanation might be that the lines were initial letters of words in a sentence or verse.</p>
          <p>The edition of the book itself was from a New Zealand publisher. <span class="accent">It is so rare that an identical copy has never been found.</span></p>

          <h1>IV. The Woman</h1>
          <p>The phone number belonged to a nurse who lived near Somerton Beach named Jessica “Jo” Thomson. However, she elected to go by “Jestyn” during the case. When questioned, she said that she didn’t know the man, but had given a copy of The Rubaiyat to a man during the war by the same of Alfred Boxall.</p>
          <p>A few days later, police found Alfred to be alive and well, and he produced his copy of The Rubaiyat, which was similarly intact. </p>
          <p>When shown the bust taken of the dead man’s head and shoulders, Jessica seemed “completely taken aback, to the point of giving the appearance she was about to faint”, immediately looked away and would not look at it again. <span class="accent">Yet she maintained that she did not know who the man was.</span> </p>
          <p>In a later investigation, it was found that Jessica’s son, Robin, displayed both of the rare genetic conditions that the man had shown (ear hollows and missing teeth). <span c;ass="accent">The chances of this happening by coincidence has been estimated as between 1 in 10,000,000 and 1 in 20,000,000.</span> In an interview on 60 Minutes, Jessica’s daughter Kate said that she thinks her mother knew the identity of the man. But in 2007, Jessica took that secret to the grave.</p>

          <h1>V. The End</h1>
          <p>In over 70 years since the Somerton Man’s death (as he came to be known), the mystery of his identity, his death, and his connection to Jessica Thomson and The Rubaiyat have inspired much speculation and many theories.</p>
          <p>Was the man was a spy operating during the beginnings of the Cold War, Jessica his confidante, The Rubaiyat a secret codebook disguised as poetry? Was he Robin Thomson’s father, in Adelaide to finally see his son and prior lover, the code a simple way of remembering some fact or task, written in a favorite book for safekeeping?</p>
          <p>In all theories, there are still so many unanswered questions. Why was the book thrown in the back of a parked car, and why rip out the final words? Was the poison administered as murder, or suicide, or was the cause of death not poison at all? With the advance of modern technology, <span class="accent">the answer soon might be in our grasp.</span></p>
