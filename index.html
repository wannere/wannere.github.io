          <p class="mainPage__about--p">I'm a graphic design student at Western Washington University. ​Although I am in my fourth year of higher education, I have been doing digital creative work for over six years. Currently I am also employed in WWU's University Residences IT Department as a web designer. <br/> <br/> After graduation (expected June 2019) I hope to become an in-house graphic designer somewhere on the West Coast. Until then, I hope to further my knowledge of both graphic design and web design through my education and work in Residential Technology. <br/> <br/> “Graphic design will save the world right after rock and roll does." — <strong>David Carson</strong></p>
