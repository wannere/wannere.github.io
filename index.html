        <h5>REM Poster</h5>
        <p>This poster project was to create a poster (front and back) for an assigned song. The front is to be expressive typography that shows the title of the song and uses type to support the message of the song, while the back is functional type to show the details of a concert for the band. I was assigned the song "It's The End of the World (As We Know It)" by alternative rock band R.E.M. My concept was to take the political themes of the song and transport them to today's politics. The front shows the silhouette of an assault rifle, while the back showcases details for a charity concert on the date of the Sandy Hook shooting, the proceeds of which go to support victims of gun violence.</p>

        <h5>Chaparral Type Specimen Booklet</h5>
        <p>This project was so create a twelve page booklet showcasing a randomly chosen typeface. I chose Chaparral, and in my research I disovered that it was the last typeface Carol Twombly designed before retiring from type design and moving to the Sierra Nevada foothills, an area with a specific drought-resistant plant community referred to as chaparral. I decided to embrace this connection and style my type speciment booklet as a field guide. You can <a href="https://issuu.com/emilywanner/docs/chaparral_final">read it online on Issuu</a>.</p>

        <p>In this final project, our task was to focus on texture and explore type, shape, photos, and analogue methods. I first explored typography and photos in two separate wine redesigns, but the class unanimously agreed that I should move forward with photos. Using the texture on the back of a dumpster, I took a brand of wine called Karma and redesigned it into boxed wine with a sophisticated touch. This project also included a 3 minute pitch presentation as well as market research to influence the design.</p>

I wanted to make the feeling of this page mysterious and a little unsettling, but not scary.<a href="tamamshud.html">Visit the site here.</a></p>

        <p>While working on the website for WWU Housing, the design team decided that we wanted to show different types of dorms and amenities in icon format. I created these icons that follow Western's color guidelines and match the website's other icons for consistency. <br/>The icons show different bike storage options (indoor, covered, outdoor), different bed options (stationary, loftable, bunkable), different dorm options (hall style, suite style, apartment style), elevator access, wheelchair access, and substance free communities.</p>

        <h5>The Modern Monster</h5>
        <p>This project was for an English class based around comic books. I had to create a prototype for an art comic. My comic idea, called The Modern Monster, is centered around four young women in a world where everyone is a monster instead of a human. The comic is meant as a slice of life for the modern young woman that would give advice on issues ranging from recognizing emotional abuse in relationships to making friends in college. <br/>The four main characters pictured on this character sheet are Regan O'Connor, a demon, Samera Williams, a ghost, Valentine "V" Wu, a succubus, and Lily Simons, a swamp monster. I also designed the title for the comic, and hope to be able to produce a full issue as a passion project.</p>

        <p>This assignment was to create a character and list some facts about them. Because it was so broad, I decided to combine two of my ideas, a sword fighter and a scuba diver. My references included swimmer's legs and fencers arms, so it was interesting to combine the two in one body. I also had fun combining the scuba mask with the fencer's helmet.</p>

        <p>In this project the assignment was to create three unique GIFs that could be used as loaders, something better than just a rotating circle or three dots that change color. We were also tasked with animating the GIFs in Photoshop frame by frame, so the results are a little choppier than if they were animated in After Effects. For my loaders, I used a bow and arrow morph, orange juice being poured, and paper being crumpled up.</p>
